# Formula 1 Database System

## Disclaimers
‚ö†Ô∏è This project contains selected components from an assignment but contains only my original implementation
‚ö†Ô∏è The full implementation is not publicly available due to academic restrictions, but demonstrates core database design skills.  
‚ö†Ô∏è For complete code samples or implementation details, please contact me at zernishnazir@gmail.com. 

## Overview
A relational database system for Formula 1 racing that models championships, teams, drivers, and race results. Designed to support complex analytics including:
- Performance tracking across seasons
- Automated team standings calculation
- Race statistics aggregation

This showcase highlights my ability to transform real-world requirements into a normalized database schema with advanced SQL features.

## Key Features
**Database Design**
- 7 normalized tables (3NF compliant)
- ER modeling with cardinality constraints
- Schema optimization through iterative refinement

**Advanced Functionality**
- Triggers for automatic team points calculation
- Stored procedures for driver performance analytics
- Python-MySQL integration for dynamic queries

**Query Capabilities**
- 10+ analytical queries (results shown in report)
- Multi-table joins with aggregation
- Parameterized procedures

## Skills Demonstrated
**Database Development**
- Schema Design (ER ‚Üí Relational Mapping)
- SQL Optimization (JOINs, Subqueries)
- Data Automation (Triggers/Procedures)

**Technical Implementation**
- MySQL Constraints & Transactions
- Python DB-API Integration
- Query Performance Considerations

**Professional Practices**
- Comprehensive User Documentation
- Academic Integrity Compliance
- Edge Case Handling

## Included Files
`user guide.docx` - Complete system documentation  
`report.docx` - Design process with sample outputs  
`advanced_features_samples.sql` - Excerpts of trigger/procedure implementations  

## Usage Notes
1. The provided files demonstrate design thinking without exposing academic solutions
2. Sample queries in the report show analytical capabilities
3. Full implementation available for discussion during interviews
